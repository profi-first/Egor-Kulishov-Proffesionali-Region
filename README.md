This repository presents two models and their training and application code for recognizing text on Russian license plates. 
Two neural network models trained on Yolov8 are used, the first model recognizes the license plate number in the image and cuts it out, and the second model recognizes the text on the license plate number character by character. Yolov8 is used because this model currently handles the task of detecting objects in an image in a data-constrained environment with the least loss.
In the folder datasets there are three archives with datasets for training, upload them to Google Disk if you want to train the neural network yourself
In the models folder there are two models already trained by me, upload them to Google Disk if you don't want to train the neural network again
If you do not want to train the neural network again, but just want to use an already trained model, skip the sections "Importing and preparing a dataset" and "Models training"
